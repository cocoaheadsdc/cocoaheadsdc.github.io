        <em>Topic</em>
        If it's related to software development using Apple technologies then we want to hear about it. Some example topics would be developing apps for iOS, programming in MacRuby for OSX and creating hardware-accelerated WebKit transformations in CSS. Yet despite how varied our topics are, we cannot accommodate every request. Presentations on universal frameworks such as PhoneGap are not appropriate nor are any subjects that are under Apple's NDA. That being said there are plenty of fantastic topics out there to speak on so if you have a question about one please don't hesitate to <a href='mailto:sean@cocoaheadsdc.org'>email us</a> and ask.

        <em>Duration</em>
        Talks should aim to be 30 minutes in length with at least five minutes allotted for Q &amp; A. Practice your speech at least a few times keeping in mind that during the actual presentation you will probably speak faster. We don't expect you to be a professional speaker but we do want to make sure we have enough content to fill the allotted time.

        <em>Format</em>
        We appreciate those speakers who give us a copy of their slides so that they can be posted to our Archives page. When creating your presentation feel free to do so in whatever application you wish so long as it is exportable to PDF. Keynote, PowerPoint and Google Presentation are popular options. Please keep the animations and embedded video to a minimum to make the process of exporting to PDF as simple as possible.

        <em>YouTube</em>
        We aim to upload all of our talks to YouTube. Uploaded talks will consist of an audio recording of your presentation along with what was displayed on the projector, much like a WWDC presentation. If however you'd prefer to upload a separately recorded version of your talk please let us know so we can make it available from our YouTube channel.
